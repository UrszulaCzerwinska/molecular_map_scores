# Intro

In this repo there are input files used to compute the module activity scores

# Detail

- **preprocessed2** the gene expression of NK and Macrophages after outlier removal and double centering, those files were an input into ICA algorithm that computed cell ranks

- **ica** ranks files computed by ICA for the full ICA files [see](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19oFOueuaEQ3N1X-s8zkcpbUE1l0GYeJd)

- **maps** the gmt and txt filesof the molecular maps modules for the meta map and the cell specific maps nk and macrophages
